# Snake

This is my small project for the implementation of the Snake game in C# using the `SFML.Net` library.

I am still trying to improve my skills :)

# Addition of a task

For more interest, I decided to complicate the initial task of writing the game: `write my own UI and scene manager for it`.
It seems to me that the task has been completed :)

# Game

Here you can see screenshot of the game:
